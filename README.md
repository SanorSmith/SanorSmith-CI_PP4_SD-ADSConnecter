## Design

### Colors
- The color scheme is modern and professional, using shades of blue, grey, and white for clarity and focus.

<img src="docs/color_palette.jpg">

### Fonts

The project uses a combination of fonts for clarity and visual appeal:

1. **Roboto** - A modern sans-serif font used for its readability and versatility across different screen sizes, ideal for body text and interface elements.

2. **Open Sans** - Complements Roboto with its simple, clear design, often used for body text, buttons, and forms.

3. **Lora** - A serif font used for headers and subheadings, adding a classic and elegant touch to contrast the sans-serif fonts.

This mix ensures readability and a professional look across all pages.

The structure utilizes Django's templating system, with `base.html` as the foundation, allowing consistent styling across all pages.

#### Database

- The backend uses Django with PostgreSQL for data management in the deployed version.
- Two main models represent the structure of the data stored in PostgreSQL, mimicking the database's contents.


The models representing the website's database structure are:

##### User Model
- Part of Django's built-in authentication system.
- Manages user-related information (username, email, password, etc.).

##### UserProfile Model
- Contains additional user details: bio and contact_info.
- Has a one-to-one relationship with the User model.

##### Service Model
- Stores service details with fields: title, description, occupation, contact_info, featured_image, created_at, and updated_at.
- Has a foreign key relationship with User, representing the service author.

##### ServiceCategory Model
- Represents different categories for services.
- Contains a single `name` field that defines the service category.

These models provide the fundamental data structure for user profiles, service listings, and service categorization, ensuring efficient data handling and retrieval within the application.

       - Verify that a new user can successfully register with valid details.
       - Test registration with invalid data (e.g., existing email/username, mismatched passwords) to ensure appropriate error messages.
     - *Login*:
       - Ensure that registered users can log in using valid credentials.
       - Test login with invalid credentials (wrong username/password) to confirm error handling.

       - Ensure users can edit their existing services.
       - Confirm that only valid data is accepted when updating a service.
